<h2>Description</h2>

This coin toss app was created as a learning tool to practice Python, Kivy, and creation of Android and Apple mobile applications. 

The game invites the user to guess whether the coin toss resulted in "heads" or "tails".

The responses are generated randomly using Python's "Random" method, with hard coded response choices. 

Currently there are only a few response choices.

The UI is simple and designed for utility rather than aesthetics.
